# Pomodoro Web App

This is a bit of a small pomodoro project for practise and for usefulness

## Overview

### Tech Stack (so far)
**Front-End**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
**Back-End**: JavaScript, Express.js

### Functionality

* Has working timer
* You can input a value (minutes) into the field, and timer will be set using this value
* (Small questionable moment: upon switching to break or work state, it uses the value that is currently in the field, potentially instead of original value)

### It Will Have

* Settings where you can more easily set work time and rest time
* Tasks you can set yourself, with optional work and rest time (If not put down, then settings value is used)
* Memory, it will remember your sessions
